    "story": "In the mid-19th century, amidst the lush landscapes of Simo, Boyolali, a single family ignited a movement that would transform their community and lay the foundation for the North Central Java Christian Church (GKJTU). The story begins with D.D. Le Jolle, a plantation entrepreneur, and his family, who embraced the gospel with fervor, not just within their household but extending their faith to their employees and the surrounding village. This initial act of faith and evangelization set in motion a journey of growth, challenge, and unwavering belief.",

    "title": "Mission and Evangelism in the Era of Mrs. Le Jolle (1850-1857)",
    "story": [
      "The Central North Java Christian Church (GKJTU) originated from a Dutch woman named Ellise Johanna le Jolle in the village of Simo, Boyolali. Although the Le Jolle family was already Christian, Mrs. Le Jolle experienced a special conversion in 1850, as she wrote in her autobiography:",
      "“There, in solitude, the voice of love was so pressing. God has long been trying to awaken faith in my heart. A deep feeling of sinfulness made me fall to my knees. When I opened the Bible, I found John 14, an amazing verse appeared: 'Whoever believes in God also believes in Me.' It comforted and encouraged my soul and filled it with peace that surpasses all understanding” (E.J Vollenhoven. “Einiges aus dem Leben”, M. u. H June 1906, column 116-117)",
      "Afterwards, Mrs. Le Jolle underwent a renewal of faith and became 'mission minded.' She began to proclaim the gospel to the laborers working on her plantation. However, she encountered obstacles because at that time the laborers were afraid of the Dutch and were difficult to approach. On the other hand, she had difficulty communicating because she could not speak Javanese and could only speak Malay. These obstacles did not make her give up; the D.D.Le Jolle family contacted Rev. Jellesma from Mojowarno (GKJW). Subsequently, a disciple of Rev. Jellesma, Petroes Sadaja or Pieter Sadaya, was sent to teach her workers. Every Sunday, Mrs. Le Jolle and Petroes Sadaya would discuss a Bible theme in Malay, then Sadaya would preach it in the Sunday service.",
      "Around the year 1855, Elise, assisted by Hoezoo, requested permission from the Dutch government to clear a forest and make it a settlement. Elise was allowed to clear a forest in the Salatiga area, and the place was named Njemoh (Nyemoh), now called Wonorejo. A number of 50 Elisabeth's laborers moved to that place. There, Sedaya became the community leader, while Elisabeth supported from behind, and Hoezoo acted as a kind of consul. In 1857, Elisabeth had to return to the Netherlands because her husband died. This event marked the beginning of the fellowship problem in Njemoh.",
      "In the same year, Le Jolle returned to the Netherlands and married Van Vollenhoven. Even in the Netherlands, Le Jolle still thought about the congregation in Njemoh so that they could continue to live and be served. Then she contacted Rev. HW Witteveen, who served in the congregation of Ermelo-Netherlands. After a discussion, R.de Boer was sent to Njemoh on October 27, 1868, and arrived on June 4, 1869. The congregation in Njemoh grew to 70 people by 1876. In 1881, the Njemoh hamlet was merged with other hamlets to become a village with a Christian headman. The name of this village is Wonoredjo."
